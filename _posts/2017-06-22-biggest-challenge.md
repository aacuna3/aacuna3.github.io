title: My Biggest Challenge
---
<h1>Learning to code is hard, ya'll</h1>
<p>A lot of coding is just memorizing things. You memorize the way to write paragraphs or format a website, to make a css file. However, a lot of coding especially with JavaScript is logic based formulas. <br>These were <strong>so</strong> difficult to learn. <br> They weren't like algebra where you would learn just <strong>one</strong> formula, and that was all you need and it would always output the same way. With coding there are always a million different ways to write the same function. It is a puzzle of how to talk to the computer to get it to do exactly what you want. This was very difficult for me as a prior English, as the statements didn't always make sense and in coding a space is never "just a space". You are talking to a computer. That rewiring of my thought process was very difficult.</p>
