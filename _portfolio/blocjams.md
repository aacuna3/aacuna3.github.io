## Explanation
Everyone is always looking for a new way to stream and play music. As a student at Bloc, part of the curriculum is to build working websites. BlocJams was my first project and the beginnings of my studies as a software developer.

## Problem
The Problem with BlocJams was- as a beginning developer, I only had the bare bones fundamentals in my arsenal of tools to complete this project. Some of the code was pre-written, some of the functions were not. Throughout the building of this functional music player, I had to use the knowledge that I had only learned recently and turn it into something tangible.

## Solution
Using many resources including previous lessons and the aid of my mentor, I was able to not only learn how to write the code for BlocJams but also how to debug it and check my work.

## Results
After testing each step of the way and finding some errors such as color errors and my player load bar not starting at zero at page load, I was able to troubleshoot and fix my website as a I went along. The end result was a real working music player! Something that blew my mind as a real newbie to this world.

## Conclusion
Going into this project I was very intimidated, I had some experience writing basic HTML but incorporating JavaScript and jQuery were completely new concepts to me. They all took some trial and error to learn. In the future, I have learned that troubleshooting prior to making commits is really crucial. If you don't, then it can cause so many errors in the future.
